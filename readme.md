# Kurejito
_Kurejito is Japanese for "credit" - or rather, it's the English word as pronounced when written in Kanji._  [@dylanbeattie](http://twitter.com/dylanbeattie/status/4526129926901760)

.NET/Mono library providing simple and consistent access to as many payment gateways as possible.  
Sparked by this [tweet](http://twitter.com/dylanbeattie/status/4143251615383552) and galvanised by the existence of [Active Merchant](http://www.activemerchant.org/).

## Draft 0.1 Plan
_Keep it simple.  One assembly, basic functionality, no dependencies. Build, discuss, re-design, re-factor, rinse-repeat._

### Build the minimum viable implementation
* Datacash [@dylanbeattie](http://twitter.com/dylanbeattie)
* SagePay [@dylanbeattie](http://twitter.com/dylanbeattie)
* TBC [@bentayloruk](http://twitter.com/bentayloruk)
* TBC @you-yes-you-know-you-want-to-get-involved

### Tech
* .NET 3.5
* C#
* xUnit tests.
* Visual Studio 2010 sln.

### What can you do?
We'd love to get as many people involved as possible.  Right now it is early days and we're just hacking the basics, so it's difficult to divvy up tasks.  Suggestions would be:

* Follow the [#kurejito hashtag](http://twitter.com/#search?q=%23kurejito)
* Tell us about good code with a friendly license that we might want to look at.
* Anything else you can think of that will make this a success!
